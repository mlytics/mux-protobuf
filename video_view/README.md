# Mux Data Streaming Exports of Video Views

Mux Data can stream views for customers on Media plan to an Amazon Kinesis or Google Pub/Sub endpoint in the customerâ€™s cloud account. Views are sent to Kinesis or Pub/Sub as they complete and are made available to customers to retrieve from the stream within about one minute after the view ends.

See our [Streaming Exports guide](https://docs.mux.com/guides/data/export-raw-video-view-data#stream-views-as-they-complete) for more information on setting up streaming exports of video views.
